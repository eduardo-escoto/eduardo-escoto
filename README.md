### Hey! I'm Ed! :3
I'm currently a First year PhD Student working on Generative Music, Recommender Systems, and Multi-Modal Models. As of now, I'm pretty interested in Flow Matching and Diffusion models and how to induce notions of generative controllability. I'm a big fan of hyperpop, tabletop rpgs, and spending more time trying to automate silly tasks than they would usually take.
